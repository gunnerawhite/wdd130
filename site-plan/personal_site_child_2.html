            <h1>V Rising</h1>
            <p>V Rising is currently in Steam Early Access, and has already become an instant hit. It’s been likened to another early access survival game, Valheim, which released in early 2021. In this isometric open-world game, you and your pals play as weak vampires that must regain strength by hunting for blood and building up your knowledge of the world after a long slumber in a coffin. You can play solo or online with or against other vampires fighting all sorts of unholy monsters and evil creatures, all the while evading daylight and building a base worthy of Dracula. Want to know how to start this game off right? Click the link below and learn how to build a base in V Rising, as well as how to get all the best V Rising weapons.</p>

            <h1>Lego Starwars: The Skywalker Saga</h1>
            <p>The Skywalker Saga gives you another chance to immerse yourself in George Lucas’ sci-fi fantasy world in the blocky form of Lego. But, this isn’t just a rehash of The Complete Saga with The Force Awakens tacked on: you get proper Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga space exploration in this one, which is pretty great.

            The films already covered in the game have been remade, and you can tackle them in any order. You can also explore space just as you did Lego Marvel Superheroes’ Manhattan. What’s more, you can fight and explore the inside of Star Destroyers, each made of 18 million digital bricks.</p>

            <h1>Tiny Tina's Wonderland</h1>
            <p>Any fears that Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands was going to be an ersatz Borderlands 4 were doused the moment we got our hands on the game. As Phil Iwaniauk writes in our Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands review, it’s “still recognisably Borderlands, but the sense of place and improvisation elevates Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands beyond expectations.”

            There are elements of the game that could still do with some polish, but this is an excellent entry in the popular series of FPS games that manages to avoid repeating old tropes. Definitely check it out if you’re a Borderlands fan looking for something familiar, but refreshing.</p>
